Fun fact:
Respecting norminette rules is not required in the exams...
yeah, it's fun because I respected the norm in every exam, and I didn't know untill the last second of the final exam
fortunately, I was damn used to it, but it certainly stressed me out in my very last submition,
as I had to fix tons of norminette errors in just 2 minutes (norminette be like: I will end this man's career)
thank god I fixed them all in 1m50s, pushed the exercise in the last 10 seconds, and... failure hhhhhhhhhhhhhahahahaha
result: 84
