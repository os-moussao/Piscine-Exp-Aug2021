In this repository, I shared everything I have done during the 28 days of 1337 piscine.

# Things to consider

## ft_print_combn

> C00/ex08

I added another simple solution [ft_print_combn_simple.c](C/C00/ex08/ft_print_combn_simple.c) using backtracking (don't get scared of the name young novice :joy::heart:)

## ft_ten_queens_puzzle

> C05/ex08

The code I pushed during my piscine, although it was correct, yet I still believe that it's not a good way of solving this problem.  
  
Because, when reaching a deadend or a solution, I kept calling the function backwards rather than letting it go back to its previous call stacks (if that make sense :slightly_smiling_face:). Thus, I needed to know the number of solutions beforehand if I want the function to quit.  
  
Here is another simpler solution to this problem: [the n queens](https://github.com/os-moussao/algorithms-and-data-structures/blob/master/Backtracking/01%20The%20N%20Queens/the_n_queens_puzzle.c)

## bsq

Me and [@awbx](https://github.com/awbx) have worked on the bsq project, all functional tests succeeded, but we got a SEGABORT in the basic test. Therefore, we failed this project with a 50% score.  
  
You can take some ideas from what we've done. And, you can also check our friends [@Redimber](https://github.com/Redimber) and [@XMoulinette](https://github.com/XMoulinette)'s [BSQ](https://github.com/XMoulinette/BSQ_100) with a 100% success score.
